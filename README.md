## Database Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL

Moving from MySQL to PostgreSQL means transferring data, tables, and database logic from one system to another while keeping everything accurate and consistent. Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are popular databases, but PostgreSQL offers more advanced features, better data integrity, and improved performance for complex queries. This migration can help businesses scale efficiently, improve security, and optimize database performance.

## Tools Used for Migration

pgloader – Automates schema and data migration quickly.

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) – Best for cloud-based migrations with minimal downtime.

MySQL Workbench – Exports data in SQL or CSV format for manual migration.

pgAdmin – A GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL and checking migrated data.

Custom Scripts (Python, Shell) – For customized migration processes.
